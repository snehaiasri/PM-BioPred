    **PM-BioPred** predicts the **bioactivity of small molecules** against different biological targets using machine learning and chemical descriptors computed from SMILES.
    
    -	PM-BioPred is a web-based prediction server for assessing the bioactivity of compounds against plant and microbial proteins.
    -	The tool is built on curated datasets of experimentally validated active and inactive compounds, offering prediction accuracy of 86% (plants) and >90% (microbes).
    -	It addresses the gap in computational bioactivity prediction resources for non-human systems, particularly in agricultural and microbial research.
    -	The web interface allows users to query SMILES-formatted compounds and retrieve bioactivity classifications with interpretability.
    -	PM-BioPred is freely accessible to the academic community and supports early-stage screening of agrochemicals and antimicrobial agents.


    **Input:** CSV file with `molecule_id` and `SMILES`  
    **Output:** Bioactivity prediction with probabilities  
    **Target Options:** Bacteria, Fungi, Virus, Plant
